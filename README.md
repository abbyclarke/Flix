### Notes
I am still learning about Github. I had edited this readme file directly on github, then made changes to my local repository, so when I tried to commit and push, my local repository on xcode was out of date. I did some research on pull requests and did a pull request that rebased local changes onto upstream changes. This allowed me to push my Flix part 2 code to Github, and kept the readme edits. I enjoyed working on this Flix project and seeing things come together!

### Notes
I had some difficulties using the terminal to install CocoaPods to then set up a pod and install AlamofireImage. Then I also had difficulties creating a repository on Github.
I thought I could use Github desktop and drag and drop all the folders into a new folder, but that made the build fail. I moved them back to the original folder and created a repository through Xcode to fix this issue.
