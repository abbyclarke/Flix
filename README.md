### Notes
I had some difficulties using the terminal to install CocoaPods to then set up a pod and install AlamofireImage. Then I also had difficulties creating a repository on Github.
I thought I could use Github desktop and drag and drop all the folders into a new folder, but that made the build fail. I moved them back to the original folder and created a repository through Xcode to fix this issue.
